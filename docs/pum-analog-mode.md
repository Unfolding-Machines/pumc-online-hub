# Analog Mode

Analog Mode is meant for combining the power of PUM Companion's oracles, random tables, and dice roller with your physical tabletop RPG sessions or storytelling sessions. It provides a lightweight interface to quickly get inspiration, answer questions, and roll dice without the need to create or save a full game.
