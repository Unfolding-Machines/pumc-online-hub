# Entities Overview

The Entities Overview is your command center for all the important characters, NPCs, and items in your adventure.

## Entity tab navigation

Entities are all characters, locations, and compendiums. You open them from the overview screen which shows all entities.

|---|---|
| Large screen (PC/Mac): full-width tabs with labels. | Small screen (mobile): compact icon-only tabs for small screens. |

Opening an entity will always open in a new tab within the entity panel area, and automatically switch to that tab.

You can switch between them using the tabs at the top of the entities panel.

### Opening a blank entity tab

On large display layouts, you can open a new blank entity tab by clicking the "+" button to the right of the entity tabs.

You can then set an entity for this tab manually.

### Closing and Rearranging Entity Tabs

To close an entity tab, click the "X" button on the tab itself, or with the shortcut **Ctrl + W**. On mobile, you can press and hold the tab to reveal the menu with the close option.

You can rearrange the order of the entity tabs by right-clicking (desktop) or long-pressing (mobile) on a tab to open the context menu, then selecting "Rearrange Tabs". Drag and drop the tabs into your desired order. Right click or long-press in any entity tab, then click "Lock" to save the new arrangement.
